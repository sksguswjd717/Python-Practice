# Suppose the holidays are around the corner, and the North Pole elves need your help to have thousands of LEGO toys packed up and ready for shipping.

# Create a inventory.py program with the following list:

# lego_parts = [8980, 7323, 5343, 82700, 92232, 1203, 7319, 8903, 2328, 1279, 679, 589]

# Each item in the list is the quantity of a colored part for a LEGO toy.

# Can you figure out the following information using built-in list functions?

# Which LEGO part are the elves running low on? Use min() to find out.
# Is there a LEGO part that the elves are overstocking? Use max() to find out.


# The len() function returns the total length of a list.
# The max() function returns the maximum value in a list.
# The min() function returns the minimum value in a list
