# 🥳 New Year Countdown
# 10 XP

# MEDIUM

# Instructions
# Ring in the New Year! A New Year's Eve party doesn't feel complete without a countdown from 10 to 1.

# Use a for loop that counts down by using the "step" value in range().

# Inside the loop, print the numbers from 10 to 1, each on its own line.

# When the loop finishes the countdown, print this exact string Happy New Year! 🥳.

# The output should look like this:

# 10
# 9
# 8
# 7
# 6
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
# Happy New Year! 🥳
# Counting down from 10 to 1 on each line and then a Happy New Year message at the end.

# Note: Feel free to end your message with any emoji you want!

    print("Happy New Year! 🥳")
