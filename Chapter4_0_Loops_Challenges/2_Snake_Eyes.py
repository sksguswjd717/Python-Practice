# Instructions
# Suppose we have a pair of dice. 🎲 🎲

# In dice games, "snake eyes" means rolling two 1s. Why is it called that? Because two small dots look like a pair of snake eyes. 🐍👀

# It’s the lowest possible roll (1 + 1 = 2) and is seen as bad luck. 😅

# Let's keep rerolling two dice until we get snake eyes.

# Nope
# Nope
# Nope
# Nope
# Snake eyes!
# First, use the random module to “roll” the two dice.

# Each die (named die1 and die2) should have an integer value from 1 to 6.

# Store the sum of the two random values in variable named total.

# Using a while loop, check if total is 2. If it isn't, print the string 'Nope' and keep "rerolling" the dice.

# Let the loop run until the total is 2, then print 'Snake eyes!
