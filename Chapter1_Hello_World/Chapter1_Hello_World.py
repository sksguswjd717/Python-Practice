Suppose we want the output to look exactly like this pattern below:

       1
     2 3
   4 5 6
7 8 9 10

How can you do that?

Create a pattern.py program that prints this pattern exactly as shown.

This will likely take some trial and error, but give it a shot!

"""
Create an initials.py program that displays your initials in block letters.

First, start the program with a comment that says a fun fact about yourself.

Then, create your block letters with your initials.

For example, if your name is Dua Lipa, your initials would be D and L, and your block letters would look like this:

DDDD   L
D   D  L
D   D  L
D   D  L
D   D  L
D   D  L
DDDD   LLLLL
"""

print('DDDD     L')
print('D    D   L')
print('D    D   L')
print('D    D   L')
print('D    D   L')
print('D    D   L')
print('DDDD     LLLLL\n')

"""
Create a blank letter.py program.

In this exercise, you will write a letter to your future self... in Python.



Take a moment and think about what you hope to achieve on this journey.

Use print() to output:

Today's date.
How you are feeling right now.
What you want to accomplish by learning to code.
A message to your older, wiser, and programmer self.
Your favorite emoji to spice things up!
When it's done, take a screenshot and click the Twitter icon to post your letter!

P.S. We will return the letter when the time is right. 😊
